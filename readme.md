# BasicNFT Project

## Overview

The **BasicNFT** project is a simple Ethereum-based ERC721 non-fungible token (NFT) smart contract built using Solidity. It allows users to mint NFTs with associated token URIs (typically pointing to metadata stored on IPFS or similar decentralized storage). The project includes a deployment script and unit tests, utilizing the Foundry framework for development and testing.

### Features
- **ERC721 Compliance**: Inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC721 implementation for standard NFT functionality.
- **Minting**: Users can mint NFTs, each associated with a unique token URI.
- **Token URI Storage**: Stores token URIs on-chain, mapping them to token IDs.
- **Deployment Script**: A Foundry script to deploy the contract to a blockchain.
- **Unit Tests**: Tests to verify the contract's name and minting functionality.

### File Descriptions
- **BasicNFT.sol**: The main smart contract implementing the ERC721 standard. It includes functions to mint NFTs and retrieve token URIs.
- **DeployBasicNft.s.sol**: A Foundry script to deploy the `BasicNFT` contract to a blockchain.
- **TestBasicNft.t.sol**: Foundry-based unit tests to verify the contract's functionality, including name verification and minting.

## Prerequisites

To work with this project, you need the following tools installed:
- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry): A blazing-fast Ethereum development toolkit.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional, for additional tooling or scripts).
- An Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) with testnet funds for deployment (if deploying to a testnet).
- Access to an Ethereum node or provider (e.g., Infura, Alchemy) for deployment.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd BasicNFT
   ```

2. **Install Foundry**:
   If Foundry is not installed, run:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   The project uses OpenZeppelin contracts. Install them using Foundry's dependency management:
   ```bash
   forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
   ```

   Ensure the `lib/` directory contains the OpenZeppelin contracts.

4. **Configure Environment**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root for deployment (if needed):
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

   Add the following variables:
   ```
   PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>
   RPC_URL=<your-ethereum-rpc-url> # e.g., Infura or Alchemy URL
   ```

   Load the environment variables:
   ```bash
   source .env
   ```

## Usage

### Compiling the Contracts
Compile the smart contracts using Foundry:
```bash
forge build
```

### Running Tests
Run the unit tests to verify the contract functionality:
```bash
forge test
```

To see detailed test output (including traces):
```bash
forge test -vvv
```

The tests include:
- `testNameIsCorrect`: Verifies that the NFT contract's name is set to "VeeFour".
- `testCanMintAndHaveABalance`: Tests minting an NFT and checks the owner's balance and token URI.

### Deploying the Contract
Deploy the `BasicNFT` contract to a blockchain (e.g., a testnet like Sepolia):
```bash
forge script script/DeployBasicNft.s.sol:DeployBasicNft --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

This command:
- Uses the `DeployBasicNft` script to deploy the contract.
- Requires an Ethereum RPC URL and a private key set in the `.env` file.
- Broadcasts the transaction to the specified network.

### Interacting with the Contract
Once deployed, you can interact with the `BasicNFT` contract using tools like:
- **Foundry's `cast`**: To call contract functions or query state.
- **Ethers.js** or **Web3.js**: For front-end integration.
- **Remix IDE**: For manual interaction.

Example: Mint an NFT using `cast` (replace `<contract-address>` with the deployed contract address):
```bash
cast send <contract-address> "mintNft(string)" "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<your-ipfs-hash>" --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

Example: Query the token URI for token ID 0:
```bash
cast call <contract-address> "tokenURI(uint256)" 0 --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

## Smart Contract Details

### BasicNFT.sol
- **Contract Name**: `BasicNFT`
- **Inheritance**: Inherits from OpenZeppelin's `ERC721` contract.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the ERC721 token with the name "VeeFour" and symbol "VFR".
- **State Variables**:
  - `s_tokenCounter`: Tracks the total number of minted NFTs (used as token IDs).
  - `s_tokenIdToUri`: Maps token IDs to their respective token URIs.
- **Functions**:
  - `mintNft(string memory tokenUri)`: Mints a new NFT to the caller's address and associates it with the provided `tokenUri`.
  - `tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the token URI for a given token ID, overriding the ERC721 implementation.

### Key Features
- **Minting**: Any user can call `mintNft` to create a new NFT. The token ID is incremented automatically.
- **Token URI**: Stores metadata URIs on-chain, typically pointing to IPFS or other decentralized storage.
- **ERC721 Compliance**: Supports standard NFT operations like `balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, and `transferFrom`.

## Testing

The `TestBasicNft.t.sol` file includes two unit tests:
1. **testNameIsCorrect**:
   - Verifies that the contract's name is "VeeFour".
   - Uses `keccak256` to compare strings (since direct string comparison isn't supported in Solidity).
2. **testCanMintAndHaveABalance**:
   - Simulates minting an NFT for a test user.
   - Checks that the user's balance is 1 after minting.
   - Verifies that the token URI for token ID 0 matches the expected IPFS URI.

To run specific tests:
```bash
forge test --match-test testNameIsCorrect
```

## Deployment

The `DeployBasicNft.s.sol` script deploys the `BasicNFT` contract. It:
- Uses Foundry's `Script` base contract.
- Calls `vm.startBroadcast()` and `vm.stopBroadcast()` to simulate a transaction.
- Returns the deployed `BasicNFT` contract instance.

To deploy to a specific network, ensure the `RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` are set correctly in your `.env` file.

## Example Workflow

1. **Compile and Test**:
   ```bash
   forge build
   forge test
   ```

2. **Deploy to a Testnet** (e.g., Sepolia):
   ```bash
   forge script script/DeployBasicNft.s.sol:DeployBasicNft --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
   ```

3. **Mint an NFT**:
   Use a tool like `cast` or a front-end to call `mintNft` with an IPFS URI.

4. **Verify Token URI**:
   Query the `tokenURI` function to ensure the metadata is stored correctly.

## Limitations
- **On-Chain URI Storage**: Storing token URIs on-chain can be gas-intensive for large-scale projects. Consider using off-chain storage or standards like ERC1155 for more complex use cases.
- **No Access Control**: The `mintNft` function is public, allowing anyone to mint NFTs. Add access control (e.g., `onlyOwner`) if restricted minting is desired.
- **No Metadata Validation**: The contract does not validate token URIs. Ensure valid URIs are provided during minting.

## Future Improvements
- Add access control for minting (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`).
- Implement batch minting for efficiency.
- Add events for minting and other key actions.
- Support upgradable contracts using OpenZeppelin's `UUPS` or `Transparent` proxy patterns.
- Include metadata validation or off-chain URI resolution.
